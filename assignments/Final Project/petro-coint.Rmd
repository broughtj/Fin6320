## Introduction 

We will examine the NYMEX futures data for petroleum contracts, specifically the ones for WTI Crude Oil and New York Harbour Heating Oil. 

To match the Alizadeh & Nomikos analysis we will use the weekly data from August 1989 to September 20, 2006. 

***NB:*** In the video I pulled daily data and worked with the full time series. This represents an update to that analysis.
